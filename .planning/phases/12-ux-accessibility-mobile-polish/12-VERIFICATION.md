## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `useMediaQuery` uses `useSyncExternalStore` with `matchMedia` for tear-free concurrent-safe reads | ✓ VERIFIED | `useMediaQuery.ts:1,20` — `import { useSyncExternalStore }` + `useSyncExternalStore(subscribe(query), getSnapshot(query), getServerSnapshot)` |
| 2 | `useReducedMotion` returns true when OS prefers-reduced-motion is set to reduce | ✓ VERIFIED | `useReducedMotion.ts:4` — `return useMediaQuery("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)")` |
| 3 | `useHighContrast` returns true when OS prefers-contrast is set to more | ✓ VERIFIED | `useHighContrast.ts:4` — `return useMediaQuery("(prefers-contrast: more)")` |
| 4 | `useOnlineStatus` returns `navigator.onLine` and updates on online/offline events | ✓ VERIFIED | `useOnlineStatus.ts:13` — `getSnapshot` returns `navigator.onLine`; subscribe adds online/offline event listeners |
| 5 | `useHapticFeedback` feature-detects `navigator.vibrate` and silently no-ops on unsupported browsers | ✓ VERIFIED | `useHapticFeedback.ts:4,9,14` — every method guards with `if ("vibrate" in navigator)` |
| 6 | `useLocaleFormat` reads `i18n.language` (not hardcoded locale) for all Intl formatting | ✓ VERIFIED | `useLocaleFormat.ts:5-6` — `const { i18n } = useTranslation(); const locale = i18n.language` |
| 7 | Global CSS reduced-motion override sets animation-duration and transition-duration to 0.01ms | ✓ VERIFIED | `index.css:264-275` — `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` sets both to `0.01ms !important` |
| 8 | Global CSS high-contrast override increases border and ring visibility | ✓ VERIFIED | `index.css:276-291` — `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` sets `--border` and `--ring` CSS vars |
| 9 | All new i18n keys exist in both `it.json` and `en.json` | ✓ VERIFIED | `it.json:5-6,8-13,150-152,307-309` and `en.json:5-6,8-13,152,307-309` — all Phase 12 keys present |
| 10 | Zero instances of hardcoded `"it-IT"` remain in any `.tsx` or `.ts` source file (outside voice locale code) | ✓ VERIFIED | grep shows 0 results in `ChatScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `UncategorizedScreen`, `QuestionnaireScreen`; `useVoiceInput.ts` and `useTTS.ts` are legitimately excluded (dynamic voice locale tag) |
| 11 | All `toLocaleString`/`Intl.NumberFormat` calls in 4 screen files use `useLocaleFormat` hook | ✓ VERIFIED | All 4 files import `useLocaleFormat` and call `const fmt = useLocaleFormat()` |
| 12 | The 3 hardcoded Italian `/anno` strings replaced with `t('profile.perYear')` | ✓ VERIFIED | `QuestionnaireScreen.tsx:620,624,628` — `{t("profile.perYear")}` |
| 13 | Regression test guards against future `it-IT` re-introduction | ✓ VERIFIED | `src/test/no-hardcoded-locale.test.ts` — uses `import.meta.glob` to scan all non-test source files |
| 14 | `OfflineBanner` uses `role="alert"` for screen reader accessibility | ✓ VERIFIED | `OfflineBanner.tsx:13` — `role="alert"` |
| 15 | `OfflineBanner` sits at `z-[35]` — above header (`z-30`) but below sidebar overlay (`z-40`) | ✓ VERIFIED | `OfflineBanner.tsx:14` — `z-[35]` in className |
| 16 | `OfflineBanner` is integrated into `AppShell` layout | ✓ VERIFIED | `AppShell.tsx:10,426` — imported and rendered after `</header>` |
| 17 | `BalanceMask` renders `****` when masked and actual value when unmasked | ✓ VERIFIED | `BalanceMask.tsx:12-20` — conditional render on `masked` prop |
| 18 | `BalanceMask` reads privacy preference from localStorage key `senso:balanceMask` | ✓ VERIFIED | `ProfileScreen.tsx:116` — `useState(() => localStorage.getItem("senso:balanceMask") === "true")` |
| 19 | Balance mask state toggled via an eye icon button on `ProfileScreen` | ✓ VERIFIED | `ProfileScreen.tsx:265-271` — `<button>` with `EyeOff`/`Eye` icons and `toggleBalanceMask` handler |
| 20 | `ripple-target` class added to primary action buttons in `AppShell` nav | ✓ VERIFIED | `AppShell.tsx:83,104` — `ripple-target` on both `NavItemLink` and `TopBarNavLink` elements |
| 21 | `PageTransition` wraps route content with a fade transition on pathname change | ✓ VERIFIED | `PageTransition.tsx:24-45` — `useEffect` on `location.pathname` triggers `setPhase("out")` then `setPhase("in")` |
| 22 | `PageTransition` renders children directly (no animation) when `prefers-reduced-motion` is active | ✓ VERIFIED | `PageTransition.tsx:27-29,47-48` — short-circuits to `<>{children}</>` when `reducedMotion` is true |
| 23 | Sidebar drawer transition uses `ease-out` timing and `backdrop-blur-sm` overlay | ✓ VERIFIED | `AppShell.tsx:431` — `backdrop-blur-sm transition-opacity duration-200`; `AppShell.tsx:441` — `transition-transform duration-200 ease-out` |
| 24 | Pull-to-refresh gesture implemented for `ChatScreen` and `ProfileScreen` | ✓ VERIFIED | Both files import `usePullToRefresh`; both have containerRef attached and pull indicator rendered |
| 25 | `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` set on scroll containers | ✓ VERIFIED | `ChatScreen.tsx:1670` — `overscroll-y-contain`; `ProfileScreen.tsx:247` — `overscroll-y-contain` |
| 26 | `usePullToRefresh` disables visual pull animation when `prefers-reduced-motion` active | ✓ VERIFIED | `usePullToRefresh.ts:138` — `displayDistance = reducedMotion ? 0 : pullDistance` (hides indicator; gesture still works) |
| 27 | Haptic feedback fires on pull-to-refresh trigger | ✓ VERIFIED | `usePullToRefresh.ts:89` — `haptic.tap()` when threshold reached |
| 28 | `ChatScreen` welcome message changes based on time of day | ✓ VERIFIED | `ChatScreen.tsx:943-947` — `getGreetingKey()` returns appropriate `coaching.greeting*` key; used at lines 1139, 1159, 1202 |
| 29 | Time-of-day greeting uses i18n keys, not hardcoded strings | ✓ VERIFIED | `ChatScreen.tsx:945-947` — returns `"coaching.greetingMorning"`, `"coaching.greetingAfternoon"`, `"coaching.greetingEvening"` |
| 30 | Haptic feedback fires on primary actions in `ChatScreen` (send, voice toggle) | ✓ VERIFIED | `ChatScreen.tsx:1249` — `haptic.tap()` on send; `ChatScreen.tsx:1386` — `haptic.error()` on send failure; `ChatScreen.tsx:1791` — `haptic.tap()` on voice toggle |
| 31 | `SettingsScreen` toggles use optimistic UI pattern (immediate UI update, revert on error) | ✓ VERIFIED | `SettingsScreen.tsx:97-109` — `handlePrivacyToggle` saves `previous`, optimistically sets, reverts on catch |
| 32 | All `SettingsScreen` interactive controls emit haptic feedback | ✓ VERIFIED | `SettingsScreen.tsx:89,98,236,259` — `haptic.tap()` at start of each toggle handler |
| 33 | `usePullToRefresh` imports and uses `useReducedMotion` and `useHapticFeedback` | ✓ VERIFIED | `usePullToRefresh.ts:2-3` — both imported; used at lines 30-31 |
| 34 | `PageTransition` is wired into `AppShell`, wrapping all route content | ✓ VERIFIED | `AppShell.tsx:492-494` — `<PageTransition>{children}</PageTransition>` wraps content area |
| 35 | Ripple CSS utility class implemented in `index.css` | ✓ VERIFIED | `index.css:288-326` — `.ripple-target` pseudo-element animation with reduced-motion guard |

### Requirements Coverage

**All 5 plans declare `requirements: []`** — Phase 12 was intentionally tracked as "Requirements: TBD" in the ROADMAP.md. No formal REQUIREMENTS.md requirement IDs were assigned to this phase. The REQUIREMENTS.md Traceability matrix maps all 31 v1 requirements to Phases 1–8 only; no v1 requirement IDs point to Phase 12.

**Finding:** This is not a gap. Phase 12 is a polish/quality-of-life phase that improves the UX of existing features without introducing new product capabilities. The plan frontmatter correctly reflects this with `requirements: []` on all 5 plans, and the ROADMAP notes "Requirements: TBD."

| Plan | Requirement IDs | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 12-01 | `[]` | Accounted for — no formal IDs assigned |
| 12-02 | `[]` | Accounted for — no formal IDs assigned |
| 12-03 | `[]` | Accounted for — no formal IDs assigned |
| 12-04 | `[]` | Accounted for — no formal IDs assigned |
| 12-05 | `[]` | Accounted for — no formal IDs assigned |

No orphaned requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md pointing to Phase 12.

---

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| `usePullToRefresh.ts` | 137-138 | `reducedMotion` only clamps visual `pullDistance` to 0; gesture still fires `onRefresh` | ℹ️ Info | Plan stated "disabled when prefers-reduced-motion" but actual behavior is "visual indicator hidden, refresh still triggers" | NOT a stub — this is a deliberate improvement over the plan spec (the gesture should still work; only the animation is suppressed). The inline comment at line 137 documents the intent. Acceptable. |

No blockers or warnings found. No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments in any Phase 12 file. No empty implementations, no hardcoded empty return values in rendering paths.

---

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Pull-to-Refresh on Mobile

**Test:** Open ChatScreen or ProfileScreen on mobile device (or Chrome DevTools → Devices → mobile emulation). With the page at the top, pull down firmly.
**Expected:** A loading spinner appears at the top; releasing triggers refresh; no double-refresh with browser's own pull-to-refresh.
**Why human:** Touch gesture events and scroll behavior cannot be tested programmatically without a real browser runtime.

#### 2. Reduced-Motion OS Preference Disables Animations

**Test:** Set OS reduced-motion preference (macOS: Accessibility → Display → Reduce Motion; Windows: Ease of Access → Disable animations). Navigate between pages in the app.
**Expected:** Route changes are instant with no fade animation; sidebar drawer slides in without easing animation; pull-to-refresh shows no pull indicator animation.
**Why human:** Cannot mock OS-level media query state in a static verification pass.

#### 3. Offline Banner Behavior

**Test:** Open the app → DevTools → Network tab → Check "Offline" checkbox.
**Expected:** Orange/destructive banner appears below the header with WiFi icon and Italian offline message, at the correct z-index (visible but below the sidebar when open).
**Why human:** navigator.onLine cannot be programmatically set to false in a static file scan.

#### 4. Balance Mask Persistence

**Test:** Navigate to Profile → Click the eye icon button in the heading row → Balances show `****` → Refresh the page.
**Expected:** Balances remain hidden after reload (localStorage persisted); clicking eye again reveals them.
**Why human:** localStorage read/write requires a running browser session.

---

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 35 observable truths are verified in the codebase. All 20 required artifacts exist, are substantive, and are wired. All 17 key links are confirmed. No stub implementations detected.

**One minor note on pull-to-refresh reduced-motion behavior:** The plan spec said "pull-to-refresh is disabled when prefers-reduced-motion is active" but the implementation is better — it hides the visual indicator while still allowing the refresh gesture to trigger. This is the correct UX behavior (users with reduced motion still want to be able to refresh; they just don't want the animation). This is documented in the code at line 137 and is not a gap.

**Requirement ID coverage:** All 5 plans declare `requirements: []`. REQUIREMENTS.md does not assign any v1 requirement IDs to Phase 12. This is consistent and expected — Phase 12 is a UX polish phase with no new product capabilities.
